<h2 class="about-header">The Mammal Diversity Database</h2>
<p class="about-body">
Development for this work is funded primarily by the <a href='http://www.mammalsociety.org/'>American Society of Mammalogists</a> (ASM), with initial logistical and planning support (2017-2019) provided by the <a href='http://vertlife.org/grant/'>NSF Vertlife Terrestrial grant</a>. Logistical support is now provided by the <a href='https://biokic.asu.edu/'>Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center</a> at Arizona State University.
<br>
<br>
The <a href='http://www.mammalsociety.org/committees/biodiversity'>ASM Biodiversity Committee</a> compiles and maintains the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), an updatable online database of mammal taxonomic and biodiversity information hosted by ASM at <a href='http://mammaldiversity.org/'>http://mammaldiversity.org/</a>. This database aims to provide the latest information on species-level and higher taxonomic changes, thereby promoting more rigorous study of mammalian biodiversity worldwide. The initial objective has been to aggregate, curate, and compile, new citations on species descriptions and taxonomic revisions into regular releases that are downloadable in comma-delimited format. Downstream goals include expanded hosting of ecological, trait, and taxonomic data. Overall, this initiative aims to promote the ASM’s role as a leader in high quality research on mammalian biology.

<h2 class="about-header">Content goals for improvement</h2>
<p class="about-body">

<ol type="a">
<li>
Synonyms. Our initial matching yielded synonym data for 3,113 species (1 or more junior synonym equivalency with authority & year). We also have one or more listed subspecific epithet for 1,299 species. Merging and reconciling the MSW3 data, along with data from other biodiversity aggregators (e.g., ITIS) is a priority for our group.
</li>
<li>
Type specimens. We recognize a key priority of reconciling these recent taxonomic changes in mammals with the museum location of type specimens that pertain to these recognized mammalian species. To date, we have manually added holotype museum numbers to 247 species. We also began parsing VertNet data and found 2,313 extant holotypes and 6,257 extant other types (e.g., para- and topotypes) in VertNet collections. Our aim is to focus on primary types (holotypes, lectotypes, syntypes, cotypes, and neotypes), and exclude secondary types like paratypes and topotypes.
</li>
<li>
Authority full citation & year. This content priority has become clear and will be especially useful for mammalogists without strong library resources. Our goal here is to provide the DOI and links to digitized open-source materials when available.
</li>
<li>
Improved organization of volunteers. In 2019, we assembled an initial list of per-clade ASM members and non-member specialists to help vet and provide editorial curation as the MDD taxonomy continues to evolve. See Table 2 in our 2019 Annual Report for that list of people spread across 25 taxon-specific subcommittees. However, we still lack the organizational infrastructure needed to properly use the efforts of those volunteers, so we have yet to formally reach out to them as a group. We still maintain the goals of these subcommittees as follows: 
<li>
i.	Establish group efforts such that no single individual has full authority over the advising decisions for a particular taxon. 
</li>
<li>
ii.	In keeping with the objectivity goals of the Mammal Diversity Database, only published taxonomic opinions are allowed to be considered. The taxonomic subcommittees will contain multiple voices spanning diverse perspectives toward the goal of judging which published works will be accepted into the MDD active listing. 
</li>
<li>
iii.	Thus, these subcommittees will be primarily objective, but also have limited one-directional subjective control over the accepted species in their group. While species additions must be derived from the peer-reviewed literature (including compendia), species can be excluded or ‘flagged’ for additional study under the judgement of supporting evidence by group members. 
</li>
<li>
iv.	Setting a 6-month schedule for returning an updated listing of revisions per clade; 
</li>
<li>
v.	Incorporating these per-clade updates into a full MDD version release on a 10-month basis (e.g., July to April would be useful given the June ASM meetings); and,
</li>
<li>
vi.	Giving citation credit to these taxonomic subcommittees, with author order determined by the individual subcommittees.
</li>
<li>
vii.	We emphasize that “top down” data integration will still be needed to make use of these “bottom up” volunteers, which is why we continue to propose funding for student assistants (see below).
</li>
</li>
<li>
Harmonization of the MDD web interface with existing ASM initiatives—namely Mammal Images Library and Mammalian Species. Discussions with David Huckaby (Chair of the MIL Committee) have continued, particularly in the form of his help with curating the species list. For example, Huckaby has helped us flag a series of inconsistencies with the database, which we’ve organized into 67 separate issues (see Google Sheet here). However, no additional steps were taken this year regarding a formal union of the MDD taxonomy with the taxonomy underlying the MIL. Informal discussions were also had with Meredith Hamilton (Mammalian Species EIC) about future efforts to link and index the MS accounts via the MDD taxonomy, presenting opportunities for modernizing old species accounts.
</li>
<li>
Other content-based priorities: These goals remain for longer-term implementation: 
-	Hyperlinks to new species citations (e.g., in J. Mammalogy, Mammal. Biol., Zootaxa)
-	Expansion of per-species content to include detailed natural history, ecological, and geographic information (e.g., collaboration with Animal Diversity Web).
-	Downstream: per-species info on phylogenetic position (VertLife tree of mammals), geo-distributions by region (continent, country, state in USA), and NCBI/IUCN links.
