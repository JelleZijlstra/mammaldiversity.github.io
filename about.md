<h2 class="about-header">The Database</h2>
<p class="about-body">
Development for this work is funded primarily by the <a href='http://www.mammalsociety.org/'>American Society of Mammalogists</a> (ASM), with initial logistical and planning support (2017-2019) provided by the <a href='http://vertlife.org/grant/'>NSF Vertlife Terrestrial grant</a>. Logistical support is now provided by the <a href='https://biokic.asu.edu/'>Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center</a> at Arizona State University.

The <a href='http://www.mammalsociety.org/committees/biodiversity'>ASM Biodiversity Committee</a> compiles and maintains the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), an updatable online database of mammal taxonomic and biodiversity information hosted by ASM at <a href='http://mammaldiversity.org/'>http://mammaldiversity.org/</a>. This database aims to provide the latest information on species-level and higher taxonomic changes, thereby promoting more rigorous study of mammalian biodiversity worldwide. The initial objective has been to aggregate, curate, and compile, new citations on species descriptions and taxonomic revisions into regular releases that are downloadable in comma-delimited format. Downstream goals include expanded hosting of ecological, trait, and taxonomic data. Overall, this initiative aims to promote the ASMâ€™s role as a leader in high quality research on mammalian biology.
