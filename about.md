<h2 class="about-header">The Mammal Diversity Database</h2>
<p class="about-body">
Development for this work is funded primarily by the <a href='http://www.mammalsociety.org/'>American Society of Mammalogists</a> (ASM), with initial logistical and planning support (2017-2019) provided by the <a href='http://vertlife.org/grant/'>NSF Vertlife Terrestrial grant</a>. Logistical support is now provided by the <a href='https://biokic.asu.edu/'>Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center</a> at Arizona State University.
<br>
<br>
The <a href='http://www.mammalsociety.org/committees/biodiversity'>ASM Biodiversity Committee</a> compiles and maintains the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), an updatable online database of mammal taxonomic and biodiversity information hosted by ASM at <a href='http://mammaldiversity.org/'>http://mammaldiversity.org/</a>. This database aims to provide the latest information on species-level and higher taxonomic changes, thereby promoting more rigorous study of mammalian biodiversity worldwide. The initial objective has been to aggregate, curate, and compile, new citations on species descriptions and taxonomic revisions into regular releases that are downloadable in comma-delimited format. Downstream goals include expanded hosting of ecological, trait, and taxonomic data. Overall, this initiative aims to promote the ASM’s role as a leader in high quality research on mammalian biology.

<h2 class="about-header">Taxonomic overview</h2>
<p class="about-body">

The Mammal Diversity Database (MDD), originally released in 2018, aims to provide a continuously updated listing of the world’s mammal species and higher taxa (all ranks above the species level). The primary goal of the MDD is to centralize information regarding the most recent and reliable systematic publications for each clade, offering up the taxonomic consequences of those works with a limited amount of subjective curation on behalf of the MDD Team. Foremost, the MDD aims to adhere to open science principles by providing streamlined access to the compiled data from our taxonomic curation efforts.
</p>
<p>
The MDD includes webpages for each species of currently recognized mammals, including taxonomic comments regarding changes since the <i>Mammals Species of the World, 3rd Edition</i> (MSW3; (Wilson and Reeder 2005)), and fields for type locality, higher-level taxonomy, common names, and updated country-level distributions. More fields of information are available in the <a href="/assets/data/MDD.zip">download of the MDD</a> (ZIP archive with CSV database & metadata). Some species currently also include the original name combination as spelled in the original taxonomic description of that species, original description citations, links to those publications, holotype voucher specimens, and nominal synonyms in a format similar to MSW3. This information is <b>still a work in progress</b> and is primarily under manual curation, so errors of omission or orthography may still be present. The MDD Team is also working on systematically curating synonyms from large publications such as the <i>Mammals of South America</i> and the <i>Taxonomy of Australian Mammals</i>, for which future updates will include compiled information. Subspecies have not yet been addressed here due to their inconsistent historical usages in mammalogy, although future efforts are likely to compile subspecies information for the purposes of species-level synonymy. The MDD is being regularly updated, so users are encouraged to contact the MDD team to report errors, new taxonomic arrangements, or queries regarding the taxonomy and interface via email: <b>mammaldiversity [at] gmail [dot] com</b>.
