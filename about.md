<p class="about-body">
Development for this work is funded by American Society of Mammalogists with logistical and planning
support from the NSF Vertlife Terrestrial grant and commissioned by the American Society of
Mammalogists.

The ASM Biodiversity Committee stewards the Mammal Diversity Database, an updatable and online
database of mammal taxonomic and biodiversity information. This database aims to serve the global
scientific community by providing the latest information on species-level and higher taxonomic
changes, thereby promoting more rigorous study of mammalian biodiversity worldwide. The initial
objective for this online database is to aggregate, curate, and compile new citations on species
descriptions and taxonomic revisions into regular releases that are downloadable in comma-delimited
format. Downstream goals include expanded hosting of ecological, trait, and taxonomic data, and an
online forum for discussing mammalian taxonomy and systematics. By serving as both a platform and
forum, this initiative aims to stimulate interest in mammals and promote the ASMâ€™s role as a leader
in high quality research on mammalian biology.
